# Classic Arcade Game Clone

This is project 3 in the Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree program. The goal for this project was to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger. We were given a basic game loop engine and image assets, and had to add characters and implement features within the game to make it functional.

To view this project:

1. Download the project files.

		$ git clone https://github.com/programmingsteve/nanodegree-arcade-game

2. Enter the project directory and open index.html with your browser.

### Gameplay

Your goal is to reach the blue water at the top of the gameboard.

Use your left, right, up and down arrows to move the boy around the screen.

If you are hit by a bug, you will be returned to the bottom of the screen.
